# Introduction to AWS
Amazon web service is an online platform that provides scalable and cost-effective cloud computing solutions. 
# IAM (Identity and Access Management)
IAM, or Identity and Access Management, is a system that helps organizations control who can access their computer systems and data. It ensures that only authorized people can get into certain systems and perform specific actions. Think of it like a security guard who checks IDs and decides who gets in and what they can do once inside.
# EC2
Amazon EC2, or Elastic Compute Cloud, is a service from Amazon Web Services (AWS) that lets you rent virtual computers to run your applications. Imagine it as renting a computer over the internet that you can use for as long as you need. You can choose the size and type of these virtual computers based on what you need, and you only pay for what you use.
# AWS Networking (VPC)
VPC stands for Virtual Private Cloud. Itâ€™s a service offered by cloud providers like AWS, VPC is a virtual network that closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center. After you create a VPC, you can add subnets.
# what is pem file
A PEM file is a type of text file used to store and share security information like certificates and keys. It's encoded in a way that makes it readable and easy to include in emails or text files. PEM files are commonly used for securing internet connections, such as with websites and email.
# Auto Scaling
In AWS (Amazon Web Services), auto-scaling is a feature that automatically adjusts the number of Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instances based on your application's needs. It means AWS will add more instances when your application needs more resources due to high demand and remove them when the demand decreases. This helps keep your application running smoothly and cost-efficiently.
# Load Balancer 
In AWS, a load balancer is a service that distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers or instances. This helps ensure that no single server gets overwhelmed with too much traffic, which improves performance and reliability. Essentially, it helps manage and balance the load so that your application runs smoothly even under heavy traffic.
