# Introduction to AWS
Amazon web service is an online platform that provides scalable and cost-effective cloud computing solutions. 
# IAM (Identity and Access Management)
IAM, or Identity and Access Management, is a system that helps organizations control who can access their computer systems and data. It ensures that only authorized people can get into certain systems and perform specific actions. Think of it like a security guard who checks IDs and decides who gets in and what they can do once inside.
# EC2
Amazon EC2, or Elastic Compute Cloud, is a service from Amazon Web Services (AWS) that lets you rent virtual computers to run your applications. Imagine it as renting a computer over the internet that you can use for as long as you need. You can choose the size and type of these virtual computers based on what you need, and you only pay for what you use.
# AWS Networking (VPC)
In AWS, a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a private network you set up in the cloud. It lets you control and manage how your cloud resources, like virtual servers, communicate with each other and the internet. Think of it as a custom, secure section of the AWS cloud where you can define your own network rules and configurations.
